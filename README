A little spreadsheet -- I've never written one before, or even really used one.


To build it:
   $ CFLAGS=-lm awk -f ake

To run it:
   $ ./vicissicalc
or:
   $ ./vicissicalc checkbook
or other filename; 'checkbook' is the supplied sample spreadsheet.


Requirements:

- Building it uses awk.
- Running it uses ANSI terminal escape codes and 'stty raw'.


Brief user manual:

- "wq" saves and quits.
- use hjkl vi keys to move around.
- use the space key to enter a value into a cell.
- Numeric values must start with =, just like formulas.
- Refer to other cells with the @ sign.  2@3 means row 2, column 3.  r
  and c are pseudovariables for the current row and column.  =(r-1)@c
  is a formula for the value in the cell above.
- Copy formulas around using the uppercase J and L keys, or
  occasionally H and K.
- If you start it without a filename, you won't be able to save your
  work.  So don't do that.
- The "w" key saves your work.  "q" quits without asking if you want
  to save unsaved changes.  So always type "wq", not just "q".
- It looks like you can move around and edit with the arrow keys, but
  you can't.
